# Beware!
This code contains mild spoilers for Gloomhaven. The names and perks of all available classes are listed in the `info.ttslua` file (and maybe somewhere else), so don't look there if that's a problem for you. :-)

# How To Use
There's not a Workshop mod yet, so here's how to set this up:
- requires Atom and the TTS plugin for Atom
- clone this repo
- within the settings of the TTS Atom plugin set the base path for includes to the path of the cloned repo
- start a new Gloomhaven game
- insert a new object (e.g. a Poker chip)
- create a new notebook named Savefile
- save the game and load it right away
- add the script from `ui.ttslua` to the object
- hit Ctrl+Shift+S in Atom
- insert the save file you want to load into the notebook
- the object now has a button, hit that and the save loads

# Known Bugs
- Removing the last card from the modifier deck doesn't work, as the deck says it doesn't have any objects left. So having all perks on one character will not work.
